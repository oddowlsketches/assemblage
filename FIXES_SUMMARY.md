# Assemblage App Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Fix (Migration: 20250529_fix_images_collections_fk.sql)
- Added `user_collection_id` column to images table for user uploads
- Added `file_hash` column for deduplication of local uploads
- Updated unique constraints:
  - `(provider, file_hash)` for uploads
  - `(provider, remote_id)` for external providers
- Added CHECK constraint ensuring correct FK usage based on provider
- Updated RLS policies to properly separate CMS vs user content

### 2. Global Supabase Client (src/lib/supabaseClient.ts)
- Created TypeScript version alongside existing JS file
- Ensures single instance using window global
- Prevents "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warnings

### 3. Upload Hook Updates (src/hooks/useImageUpload.ts)
- Added SHA-256 file hash calculation for deduplication
- Updated to use `user_collection_id` for uploads (not `collection_id`)
- Added provider='upload' to all uploaded images
- Checks for existing files before uploading to prevent duplicates

### 4. UploadModal UI Fixes (src/components/UploadModal.jsx)
- Fixed sticky footer positioning
- Hide drag instructions when files are selected
- Show smaller "Add more" dropzone after initial selection
- Fixed collection selector to be properly interactive
- Changed file preview grid to flex wrap layout
- Fixed modal overflow handling

### 5. SourceSelector Refactor (src/components/SourceSelector.jsx)
- Complete rewrite to 3-button layout:
  - Button 1: Library dropdown (Default + user collections)
  - Button 2: Image actions (Upload, Dropbox, Saved Collages)
  - Button 3: Collection management gear
- Fixed text wrapping with `whitespace: nowrap` and `minWidth: 12rem`
- Proper dropdown management with refs

### 6. CollectionDrawer Updates (src/components/CollectionDrawer.jsx)
- Removed Default Library card (ID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001)
- Updated image counts to use `user_collection_id` for uploads
- Added "View Images" button with TODO route placeholder
- Already creates corresponding image_collections entry on new collection

### 7. App.jsx Integration
- Imported and integrated new SourceSelector component
- Removed old inline dropdown implementation
- Connected all handlers properly

## Edge Cases Handled

- Prevents uploading to Default Library
- Handles auth state changes properly
- Collection creation creates both user_collections AND image_collections entries

## Known Limitations
- View Images page not implemented (shows TODO)
- Dropbox integration not fully implemented
