# Simplified Image Quality Fix for Assemblage

This is a simpler, more robust fix for the image quality issues in the Assemblage app. It addresses the image resolution problems without disrupting any of the effects or functionality.

## What This Fix Does

This simplified fix focuses only on the scaling parameters, which are the primary cause of image quality issues:

1. **Reverts Scaling Parameters**: Changes maxScale values from 2.5-3.0 back to 1.4-1.8 to prevent image over-stretching
2. **Restores Base Size Divisors**: Changes baseSizeMultiplier values from 4/6 back to 6/8 to create smaller, higher-quality tiles
3. **Fixes Multiple Effect Types**: Applies appropriate scaling limits to tiling, fragments, mosaic, and crystal generators
4. **Uses Direct Prototype Manipulation**: Modifies prototype methods to ensure the fix affects all instances of generators
5. **Avoids Timing Issues**: Doesn't rely on app initialization, works regardless of when the script loads

## Why This Fix Is Better

The previous fix had a few issues:

1. **Timing Problems**: It waited for the app to initialize, which could time out
2. **Integration Complexity**: It tried to modify too many aspects of the drawing process
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Some effects stopped working because of invasive changes

This simplified fix focuses solely on the most important issue - the scaling parameters - and uses a more reliable approach to apply the changes.

## How to Apply the Fix

### Automatic Installation

1. Make sure you're in the Assemblage root directory
2. Run the provided shell script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x apply_simplified_fix.sh
   ./apply_simplified_fix.sh
   ```

### Manual Installation

1. Place the fix script in your project's `js` directory:
   - `js/simplified_image_quality_fix.js`

2. Add the following line to your `index.html` before the closing `</body>` tag:
   ```html
   <!-- Simplified Image Quality Fix -->
   <script src="js/simplified_image_quality_fix.js"></script>
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:

1. **Improved Image Quality**: Sharper edges and better detail preservation
2. **All Effects Working**: All collage effects should continue to function normally
3. **No Console Errors**: The console should show the fix being applied without errors

## What If It Doesn't Work?

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check your browser console for error messages
2. Look for messages with the prefix `[Simplified Fix]`
3. Make sure the script is loading properly (you should see "Loading image quality fix..." in the console)
4. Verify that the script tag is in the correct position in your HTML (before the closing `</body>` tag)

## Reverting the Fix

If needed, you can easily revert by:

1. Removing the script tag from `index.html`:
   ```html
   <!-- Simplified Image Quality Fix -->
   <script src="js/simplified_image_quality_fix.js"></script>
   ```

2. Or by restoring from the backup file created during installation:
   ```bash
   cp index.html.backup-simplified-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS index.html
   ```

## Technical Details

The fix works by:

1. Directly modifying the prototype methods of generator classes (TilingGenerator, FragmentsGenerator, etc.)
2. Adjusting the scale parameters to match the values from the previous, higher-quality version
3. Using a conservative approach that only modifies the scaling logic, not the drawing or rendering code
4. Additional Math.floor enhancement that helps with pixel alignment for sharper edges

This approach maintains compatibility with all effects while improving image quality across the board.
