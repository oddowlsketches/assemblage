# Tiling Collage Fix

This directory contains fixes for the tiling collage generation in the Assemblage app.

## The Problem

The tiling collage functionality broke when the `allowImageRepetition` feature was added. The main issues were:

1. Method architecture mismatch between the working April 10 version and the current implementation
2. Missing `generateTile` method that correctly handles the repetition settings
3. Inconsistent passing of the repetition setting between generator methods

## The Solution

The fix includes:

1. A new implementation of `tilingGenerator.js` that combines the best of both versions:
   - Maintains the working tiling from April 10
   - Properly integrates the image repetition control
   - Uses a consistent approach for image selection throughout

2. An updated `generateTile` method that respects the repetition setting

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Automatic Fix

1. Open a terminal in this directory
2. Run: `chmod +x fix_tiling.sh`
3. Execute: `./fix_tiling.sh`

### Option 2: Manual Fix

1. Make a backup of your current `/js/collage/tilingGenerator.js`
2. Replace it with the file `/js/collage/newTilingGenerator.js`

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix, open the application and test both scenarios:
- Tiling collages with repetition allowed (variety in background style)
- Tiling collages with no repetition (each image appears only once)

## Reverting if Needed

If any issues occur, you can revert to your original implementation:
- If you used the automatic fix, rename `js/collage/tilingGenerator.js.bak` to `js/collage/tilingGenerator.js`
- Otherwise, restore from your manual backup
