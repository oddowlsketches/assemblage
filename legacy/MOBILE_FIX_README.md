# Enhanced Mobile Resolution Fix for Assemblage

This is an additional fix specifically targeting mobile resolution issues in the Assemblage app. It's designed to work together with the previous canvas size fix but provides extra enhancements for mobile devices.

## What This Fix Addresses

1. **Mobile-Specific Resolution Issues**: Applies special rendering techniques for mobile devices to improve image sharpness.

2. **Device-Specific Optimizations**: Adjusts canvas scaling based on the specific device type (phone vs tablet, iOS vs Android).

3. **Image Quality Enhancements**: Improves contrast, opacity, and scaling to make images more visible on smaller screens.

## Key Improvements

1. **Smart Device Detection**: Detects device type and applies optimizations specifically for mobile.

2. **DPR Capping**: Caps the device pixel ratio for mobile devices to prevent performance issues with extremely large canvases.

3. **Enhanced Rendering**: Uses `crisp-edges` and disables image smoothing on mobile for sharper image edges.

4. **Subpixel Positioning**: Uses integer pixel values for sharper rendering on high-DPI mobile displays.

5. **Increased Image Coverage**: Provides better edge coverage for images to prevent visible seams on mobile screens.

6. **Contrast & Opacity Boost**: Slightly increases contrast and base opacity for better visibility on small screens.

## How to Apply

1. Make sure you're in the Assemblage root directory.

2. Run the provided shell script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x apply_mobile_fix.sh
   ./apply_mobile_fix.sh
   ```

## Technical Details

The enhanced mobile fix:

1. Detects the device type and characteristics (mobile/tablet, screen size, pixel ratio).

2. Applies specific optimizations for mobile devices:
   - Limits DPR for very high-resolution devices to prevent performance issues
   - Uses integer pixel positions for sharper image rendering
   - Disables image smoothing for crisper edges
   - Increases contrast and brightness slightly

3. Enhances the drawing functions to provide better image quality on mobile:
   - Uses better scaling factors for image fragments
   - Improves opacity settings for better visibility
   - Enhances positioning and masking for sharper results

## Debugging

This fix includes detailed logging to help diagnose any issues:

1. Open your browser's developer console on mobile (or use remote debugging).
2. Look for log messages with the `[Mobile Fix]` prefix.
3. The fix logs detailed information about device detection, canvas configuration, and rendering adjustments.

## Note on Previous Fix

This enhanced mobile fix is designed to work alongside the previous canvas size fix. It should be applied after the canvas size fix is in place. Both fixes address different aspects of the resolution issue:

- The canvas size fix addresses the fundamental scaling and display size issues.
- This enhanced mobile fix adds specific optimizations for mobile devices.

Using both together should provide the best image quality across all devices.
