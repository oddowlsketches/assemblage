/**
 * Direct Manual Fix for Assemblage Collage Image Issues
 * Created on April 10, 2025
 * 
 * PROBLEM: The collage generator is failing to draw images with errors like:
 * "TypeError: Failed to execute 'drawImage' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': 
 *  The provided value is not of type '(HTMLImageElement or...)"
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE: The issue is in the strict type checking using instanceof HTMLImageElement
 * which is failing even though the images are loaded correctly.
 * 
 * SOLUTION: Modify the image validation checks in both collageGenerator.js and 
 * tilingGenerator.js to use a more relaxed check that doesn't use instanceof.
 */

/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. In js/collage/collageGenerator.js:
 *    Find the drawTile method (around line 470) and replace:
 *    
 *    if (!img || !img.complete || !(img instanceof HTMLImageElement)) {
 *        // Error handling
 *    }
 *    
 *    WITH:
 *    
 *    if (!img || !img.complete) {
 *        // Error handling
 *    }
 * 
 * 2. Do the same for any other instanceof HTMLImageElement checks in the file.
 * 
 * 3. In js/collage/tilingGenerator.js, check for similar validation code and make the same change.
 * 
 * 4. Optional: Add the following helper function to both files to replace instanceof checks:
 */

// Add this helper function to the top of the class
function isValidImageForCanvas(img) {
    return img && img.complete && img.width > 0 && img.height > 0;
}

// Then use it in validations like:
// if (!isValidImageForCanvas(img)) {
//    // Error handling
// }

/**
 * SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
 * 
 * 1. We're removing the instanceof HTMLImageElement check that's failing
 * 2. We're relying on simpler validation that should work across contexts
 * 3. The presence of img.complete property and img.width is sufficient
 *
 * This will fix the issue while maintaining basic validation to prevent errors.
