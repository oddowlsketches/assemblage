# CMS Upload Fix - Complete Solution

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Collection ID Error in Upload**:
   - Added validation to ensure collection ID is always present before upload
   - Added fallback to first collection if selected collection is empty
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Added useEffect to update selected collection when collections load

2. **Fixed AddImageDialog**:
   - Now properly includes collection_id when adding images via URL
   - Uses the currently selected collection

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy the code changes**:
```bash
cd /Users/emilyschwartzman/assemblage-app
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix CMS upload: ensure collection ID is always provided"
git push
```

2. **The SQL scripts from earlier should already be applied**

## What This Fixes

- **"Collection ID is required for CMS uploads" error** - Now the upload dialog ensures a collection ID is always provided
- **Images added via URL** - Now properly associated with the selected collection
- **Collection selection** - Properly initializes when the dialog opens

The CMS upload should now work correctly!
