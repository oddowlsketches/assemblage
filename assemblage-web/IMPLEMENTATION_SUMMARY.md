# Summary: User Collections UI Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Done

### Files Created in the Correct Location
All UI components have now been properly placed in `/Users/emilyschwartzman/assemblage-app/assemblage-web/`:

1. **Components** (in `src/components/`):
   - `UploadModal.jsx` - Drag-and-drop image upload interface
   - `CollectionDrawer.jsx` - Collection management drawer
   - `SourceSelector.jsx` - Source selection dropdown
   - `index.js` - Updated to export all components

2. **Hooks** (in `src/hooks/`):
   - `useImageUpload.ts` - Image upload hook with validation
   - `__tests__/useImageUpload.test.js` - Comprehensive tests

3. **Utilities** (in `src/utils/`):
   - `cn.js` - ClassName utility for Tailwind

4. **Styles** (in `src/styles/`):
   - `tailwind.css` - Tailwind imports
   - `dark-mode.css` - Dark mode styles

5. **Documentation**:
   - `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step integration instructions

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

1. **Updated `src/main.jsx`** to import Tailwind and dark mode CSS
2. **Fixed test configuration** in `vite.config.js`
3. **Created test setup** in `src/test-setup.js`
4. **Fixed CollageService test** to use Vitest

## 🎨 UI Features Implemented

- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload with preview
- ✅ File validation (type, size, dimensions)
- ✅ Automatic image compression for large files
- ✅ Collection creation and management
- ✅ Source switching between CMS and user collections
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Progress indicators

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Install any missing dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Add Supabase credentials** to your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. **Follow the INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** to integrate the components into your App.jsx

4. **Update CollageService** to handle user collections (if needed)

5. **Test the flow**:
   - Create a new collection
   - Upload images
   - Switch between sources
   - Generate collages from user images

## 📝 Notes

- All components are now in the correct directory
- The UI uses your existing authentication system
- Components integrate with your existing Supabase setup
- Tailwind CSS is already configured in your project
- Tests are passing (after fixing the mocks)

The implementation is ready to be integrated into your main App component!
