# Narrative Grid Template - Mobile Snapshot

This snapshot demonstrates the narrative grid template on mobile:
- Simplified compositions for smaller screens
- Uses simpler layouts: vertical columns, modular 2x2, overlap, focus
- 3-6 elements typically
- **Minimum 60% canvas coverage maintained**
- Same narrative panel masks
- **Elements can bleed off edges on mobile too**
- **Overlaps and transparency work the same as desktop**
- 0-20px gutter spacing maintained
- No rotation for clean alignment
- Same color handling as desktop:
  - B&W images: multiply blend mode
  - Color images: optional color echo with bgColor or white only
- Maintains original image aspect ratios

Mobile uses responsive Swiss grid principles with full dynamic features.
