# Narrative Grid Template - Desktop Snapshot

This snapshot demonstrates the narrative grid template on desktop:
- Swiss graphic design inspired layouts
- 3-8 focused elements per composition
- **Minimum 60% canvas coverage** for all compositions
- Compositions: L-dominant, asymmetric, vertical columns, modular, focus, overlap, grid-dynamic, diagonal
- Uses narrative panel masks (rectangles, squares, L-shapes)
- **Elements can bleed off canvas edges** for dynamic compositions
- **Up to 20% overlap allowed** between elements
- **Transparency range: 0.9-1.0** for overlapping elements
- 0-20px gutter spacing
- No rotation for clean alignment
- Proper color handling:
  - B&W images: multiply blend mode
  - Color images: optional color echo with bgColor or white only
- Maintains original image aspect ratios
