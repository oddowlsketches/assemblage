## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Toast styling** - Updated to use consistent white background with border
2. **Auth triggers** - Added session checks to redirect to sign-in for protected actions
3. **URL cleanup** - Added history state management to prevent unwanted redirects after auth
4. **Mobile consistency** - Ensured mobile menu items follow same auth patterns

### Files Modified:
- `/src/App.jsx` - Main application logic and auth handling
- `/src/components/SourceSelector.jsx` - Auth checks for menu items
- `/src/components/CollectionDrawer.jsx` - Already had proper signed-out handling

## Next Steps

All requested UI/UX issues have been addressed. The application now:
- Properly handles authentication states across all components
- Shows appropriate CTAs for signed-out users
- Maintains consistent white background with proper contrast
- Keeps users on the main app after signing in
- Provides clear feedback when actions require authentication
