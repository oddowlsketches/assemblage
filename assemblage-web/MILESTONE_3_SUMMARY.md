# Milestone 3 Implementation Summary

## A. 🗺 Navigation / IA clean-up ✅
1. **Top-bar buttons** - Implemented:
   - 📥 Save button with bookmark icon (no caret)
   - ➕ New button (unchanged)
   - 📂 Library selector with label and right-aligned caret
   - 🖼 Image actions with icon and caret, menu includes:
     - My Collections
     - Saved Collages
     - Dividing rule
     - Upload Images
     - Connect Dropbox (placeholder)
   - 🔍 Prompt placeholder (empty div for future use)
   - No gear icon, settings button removed

## B. 🎨 Global styling polish ✅
1. Primary buttons keep darker complementary color
2. Secondary buttons use background-color fill with complementary outline & text
3. Drop-downs & modals adopt current collage background color using `useUiColors()` hook
4. Created `useUiColors()` helper that returns `{ bg, fg, border }`

## C. 📁 My Collections surface ✅
1. CollectionDrawer shows user_collections only (no Default Library)
2. Card grid with up to 4 thumbnails or empty-state icon
3. Shows name and image count
4. Clicking card navigates to `/collections/:id` (new route)
5. Collection detail page implemented with:
   - Search, filter, sort, and thumbnail-grid browse
   - Multi-select with cmd/shift for bulk Delete / Move to another collection
   - Inline edit for title and description
   - Delete image functionality
6. "+ New Collection" opens inline dialog and navigates to new page

## D. 🖼 Upload Images modal ✅
1. Modal bg uses current `bgColor` with text/borders using `fg/border`
2. "Choose where to upload" select is active with caret visible
3. After files picked, instruction banner hidden and thumbnails shown
4. Footer buttons stick to bottom
5. POST failures surface inline toast with reason

## E. ⭐ Saved Collages page ✅
1. Route remains as modal (not changed to `/collages` as Gallery is modal-based)
2. Header bar with search + filter + sort in one line
3. Cards adopt bgColor tint instead of white
4. Clicking card opens full-size download/share functionality

## F. 🔧 Upload pipeline edge-cases ✅
1. SHA-1 calculation implemented in `utils/fileHash.js`
2. Duplicate detection ready for implementation
3. Single GoTrueClient instance used throughout via `getSupabase()`

## G. 🔌 Dropbox ✅
Placeholder menu item labeled "Connect Dropbox (coming soon)"
