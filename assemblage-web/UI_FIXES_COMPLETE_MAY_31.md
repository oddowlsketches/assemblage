## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **src/App.jsx**
   - Updated save button to show disabled state when not authenticated
   - Added toast message functionality
   - Removed isFirstSave tracking
   - Fixed save overlay to always show "View in My Collages" button

2. **src/styles/legacy-app.css**

   - Increased z-index from 30 to 2000
   - Added slideDown animation for toast messages

3. **src/components/Gallery.jsx**
   - Force white background colors by overriding useUiColors hook
   - Applied to both main Gallery component and CollageDetail modal

4. **src/pages/collections/CollectionDetail.jsx**

5. **src/hooks/useImageUpload.ts**
   - Fixed metadata_status value from 'uploading' to 'pending'

## Database Migration Required
Run the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add missing columns to images table
ALTER TABLE public.images 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived boolean DEFAULT false;

-- Update the check constraint if needed
ALTER TABLE public.images 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS check_metadata_status;

ALTER TABLE public.images 
ADD CONSTRAINT check_metadata_status 
CHECK (metadata_status IN ('pending', 'pending_llm', 'processing', 'complete', 'error', 'skipped'));

-- Add comment to explain column usage
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.images.archived IS 'Whether the image has been archived/soft deleted by the user';
```

## Visual Summary
- **Main collage view**: Continues to use dynamic colors based on the collage
- **Management views** (Gallery, Collections): Always use white background with black/gray UI elements
- **Save functionality**: Clear feedback with working buttons and proper z-indexing

## Notes
- The toast message appears when signed-out users try to save
- All gallery/collection management surfaces now have consistent white backgrounds
- The save overlay buttons should now be clickable and functional
