# Paired Forms Template Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address issues with the semi-circle and triangle shapes in the Paired Forms template.

## Semi-Circle Shape Fixes

1. **Orientation Logic**: Corrected the orientation logic to use more intuitive positioning
   - When near left edge, semi-circle is now right-facing (flat side on left)
   - When near right edge, semi-circle is now left-facing (flat side on right)
   - When near top, semi-circle is now bottom-facing (flat side on top)
   - When near bottom, semi-circle is now top-facing (flat side on bottom)

2. **Radius Calculation**: Fixed radius calculation for proper semi-circle appearance
   - Now uses height/2 for left/right orientations
   - Now uses width/2 for top/bottom orientations

3. **Arc Drawing**: Corrected arc drawing direction for bottom-facing semi-circles
   - Fixed special case for bottom orientation to draw clockwise arc
   - Updated debug outline drawing to match the actual shape

4. **Edge Connections**: Improved edge contact between semi-circles and other shapes
   - Added alignment adjustment when shapes are adjacent
   - Better center alignment when semi-circles are next to each other

## Triangle Shape Fixes

1. **Orientation Logic**: Updated for better edge contact
   - Point right when near left edge
   - Point left when near right edge
   - Point down when near top
   - Point up when near bottom

2. **Vertex Calculation**: Completely rewrote the vertex calculations
   - Fixed vertex positions for all four orientations
   - Stored additional metadata about orientation and edge points

3. **Improved Pairing**: Enhanced how triangles connect with other shapes
   - Better alignment with semi-circles when adjacent
   - Complementary orientations when triangles are adjacent

## General Layout Improvements

1. **Shape Selection**: Updated shape type selection logic in mixed layouts
   - Increased probability of triangle-semicircle pairings
   - Better complementary shape selection

2. **Edge Alignment**: Added explicit alignment for better visual contact
   - Center alignment for vertical pairings
   - Complementary orientation selection for adjacent shapes

3. **Final Adjustment**: Added finalizeEdgeContacts function for additional refinement
   - Special handling for same-type adjacent shapes
   - Orientation complementing for adjacent triangles

4. **Debug Support**: Added optional debug mode 
   - Triangle touching detection
   - Detailed shape parameter logging

These changes should result in more visually appealing and logically arranged compositions with shapes that properly touch along their edges.
