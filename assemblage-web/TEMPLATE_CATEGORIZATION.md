# Template Categorization & Naming

## Updated Categories

### üî∑ Geometric
**Description**: Mathematical patterns and precise tessellations
- **Crystal Mosaic** (crystal) - Voronoi-based crystalline patterns
- **Tile Pattern** (tilingTemplate) - Repeating tile arrangements

### ‚ûñ Minimal  
**Description**: Clean, simple compositions with breathing room
- **Film Strip** (photoStrip) - Linear strip layout like film negatives
- **Paired Elements** (pairedForms) - Two images in dialogue

### ‚ú® Abstract
**Description**: Experimental layouts with unconventional arrangements
- **Sliced Panels** (sliced) - Fragmented cuts at various angles
- **Scattered Grid** (scrambledMosaic) - Deconstructed grid with random positioning
- **Floating Shapes** (floatingElements) - Free-floating abstract elements

### üîÑ Layered
**Description**: Overlapping images with depth and transparency
- **Geometric Layers** (layeredGeometric) - Structured overlapping shapes
- **Double Exposure** (doubleExposure) - Photographic overlay effect
- **Mixed Media** (mixedMediaTemplate) - Artistic mixed compositions
- **Packed Collage** (packedShapes) - Densely packed overlapping shapes

### üìê Structured
**Description**: Grid-based and architectural organization
- **Story Grid** (narrativeGrid) - Grid layout for sequential narratives
- **Architectural** (dynamicArchitectural) - Building-inspired layouts
- **Mood Board** (moodBoardTemplate) - Pinterest-style mood board layout

## Rationale for "Abstract" Category

The Abstract category captures templates that break conventional layout rules:

- **Sliced**: Not just clean cuts but fragmented, angular divisions
- **Scattered Grid**: Intentionally disrupts grid regularity 
- **Floating Elements**: Defies traditional composition rules

These templates are about artistic expression rather than mathematical precision (Geometric) or clean simplicity (Minimal).
