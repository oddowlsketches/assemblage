# Upload Pipeline Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Migration**: `20250530_add_file_hash_and_user_collection.sql`
  - Added `file_hash` column for SHA-1 based deduplication
  - Added `user_collection_id` column for user uploads
  - Created unique index on `file_hash`
  - Added constraint to ensure proper collection assignment
  - Created `list_pending_images` function for batch processing

### 2. Edge Functions (Supabase)
- **`optimize-image`**: Handles storage trigger events
  - Generates thumbnails (placeholder for now)
  - Calculates file hash
  - Creates image records with proper provider/collection assignment
  
- **`enqueue-metadata`**: Batch processes pending images
  - Fetches up to 25 pending images
  - Would call OpenAI for metadata (placeholder implementation)
  - Updates image records with metadata

### 3. Netlify Functions
- **`upload-cms-image.ts`**: New function for CMS uploads
  - Handles base64 encoded images
  - Performs SHA-1 deduplication
  - Uploads to cms-images bucket
  - Creates proper image records

### 4. Client-Side Updates
- **`useImageUpload.ts`**:
  - Changed to SHA-1 hashing (from SHA-256)
  - Always compresses images to max 4k pixels
  - Better duplicate detection with user-friendly errors
  - Improved error handling and logging

- **`UploadModal.jsx`**:
  - Better error display for duplicates
  - Keeps modal open when errors occur
  - Removes successfully uploaded files from list
  - Clearer messaging for different error types

- **`fileHash.js`**:
  - Fixed column name from `sha1_hash` to `file_hash`

### 5. Documentation
- **`UPLOAD_PIPELINE_README.md`**: Complete setup and testing guide
- **`storage-policies.sql`**: Storage bucket RLS policies
- **`test-upload-pipeline.js`**: Test script to verify setup

## Key Improvements

1. **Performance**:
   - Client-side image resizing (4k max)
   - Direct-to-storage uploads
   - Batch metadata processing
   - SHA-1 deduplication prevents re-uploads

2. **User Experience**:
   - Real-time upload progress
   - Clear duplicate warnings
   - Automatic thumbnail generation
   - Better error messages

3. **Architecture**:
   - Clean separation of CMS vs user uploads
   - Consistent file hash approach
   - Scalable metadata processing
   - Proper RLS and storage policies

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Deploy Edge Functions**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy optimize-image
   supabase functions deploy enqueue-metadata
   ```

3. **Configure Storage**:
   - Create buckets in Supabase dashboard
   - Apply storage policies from `storage-policies.sql`

4. **Set Up Cron Job**:
   - Schedule `enqueue-metadata` to run every 5 minutes

5. **Test**:
   - Run `test-upload-pipeline.js`
   - Upload test images through UI
   - Verify deduplication works
   - Check metadata processing
