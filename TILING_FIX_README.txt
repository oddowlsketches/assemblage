# Fixing Tiling Collage Display Issues

## The Problem

The console logs show the issue: all images are being marked as "Invalid" during the tiling process.
This is happening because the image validation check is too strict. The error occurs at this line:

```javascript
if (!selectedImage || !selectedImage.complete || !(selectedImage instanceof HTMLImageElement)) {
    console.warn(`Invalid image at index ${imageIndex}`);
    return null;
}
```

This strict validation is rejecting your images, even though they're loaded correctly.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)

1. Run the simple fix script:
   ```
   chmod +x apply_image_fix.sh
   ./apply_image_fix.sh
   ```

2. Refresh your test page and the collages should now appear

This fix relaxes the image validation to only check if the image exists:

```javascript
if (!selectedImage) {
    console.warn(`Missing image at index ${imageIndex}`);
    return null;
}
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix

If you prefer to make the change manually:

1. Open `js/collage/tilingGenerator.js`
2. Find the validation code (around line 157)
3. Replace it with the simpler check shown above

## Testing

After applying the fix, the tiling collages should display properly.
The test page should show a variety of collage styles with both:
- Image repetition allowed (for more complex patterns)
- No repetition (each image appears only once)

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that the image paths are correct
3. Try reloading the page a few times

If needed, you can restore the original version:
```
cp js/collage/tilingGenerator.js.original js/collage/tilingGenerator.js
```
